The published version of this site can be viewed at https://lmburbach.github.io/school_discipline_lookup/

This applications serves as a dashboard through which users can:

* select a school system or school in the State of Georgia,
* choose from any of the following student subgroups: disability status, economic status, English learner status, gender, and race/ethnicity,
* explore a summary of the school system/school's enrollment and frequency of discipline incidents in 2017 and trends in incidents as early as 2014, and
* compare a subgroup's proportion in the overall population ot that of the disciplined student population to identify which groups are over or underrepresented in the disciplined population relative to their share of enrollment.
