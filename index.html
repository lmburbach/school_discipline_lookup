  <h1>School Discipline in the State of Georgia</h1>
</div>

<body>
  <p>Georgia’s student discipline data is collected, aggregated at the school level, and made publicly
    available
    by the <a href="https://gosa.georgia.gov/report-card-dashboards-data/downloadable-data" target="_blank">Governor’s
      Office of
      Student Achievement</a>. In this data set, a discipline incident refers to a student behavioral
    infraction
    for
    which the school issued one of the following consequences: alternative school, corporal punishment, detention,
    expulsion, in-school suspension, juvenile court/court referral, out-of-school suspension, physical restraint,
    removal
    from class, or suspension from bus. Such incidents are categorized as attendance/dress code, cheating,
    drugs/alcohol,
    gang-related behavior, harm to person, harm to property, repeated offenses, sexual offenses, or weapons.
    In addition to the discipline data from the Governor's Office of Student Achievement, data on student
    enrollment by race was gathered from the <a href="https://educationdata.urban.org/data-explorer/" target="_blank">
      Urban
      Institute's Education Data Explorer</a>.</p>
  <p>The tool below summarizes school discipline data from the 2017 school year (July 2016 - June 2017, the most recent
    year available) for a selected school system or school and shows trends up to four years prior (based on data
    availability).
    By selecting different subgroup categories, you can explore the differences in enrollment population and
    disciplined population for various subgroup categories: disability status, economic status, English learner status,
    gender, and race/ethnicity. <i>Desktop view is recommended for best experience.</i></p>
