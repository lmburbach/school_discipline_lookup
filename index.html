    <h1>School Discipline in the State of Georgia</h1>
    <p>Student behavioral incidents can be disruptive to the classroom environment, but subsequent punishments can also
      take
      away time from student learning. Much education research, especially in the last decade, has focused on how
      frequent
      suspensions and other consequences disproportionally affect students of color. Guidance from the Obama
      Administration,
      aligned with civil rights regulations, warned that schools could face federal lawsuits for disciplining students
      of
      color at rates higher than their peers. While this guidance has since been rolled back by the Trump
      Administration, the
      question of how schools discipline students of different groups and the impact that such discipline has on their
      education remains.</p>
    <p>The State of Georgia’s student discipline data is collected, aggregated at the school level, and made publicly
      available
      by the <a href="https://gosa.georgia.gov/report-card-dashboards-data/downloadable-data">Governor’s Office of
        Student Achievement</a>. According to this data set, discipline incident refers to a student behavorial
      infraction
      for
      which the school issued one of the following consequences: alternative school, corporal punishment, detention,
      expulsion, in-school suspension, juvenile court/court referral, out-of-school suspension, physical restraint,
      removed
      from class, or suspension from bus. Such incidents are categorized as attendance/dress code, cheating,
      drugs/alcohol,
      gang-related behavior, harm to person, harm to property, repeated offenses, sexual offenses, or weapons.

    <p>The tool below summarizes school discipline data from the 2016-2017 (the most recent year available) for a
      selected school or school system and shows trends since the 2013-2014 school year.
      By selecting different subgroup categories, you can explore the difference in enrollment population and
      disciplined popualtion for various subgroup
      categories: race/ethnicity, gender, disability status, economic status, and English learner status.</p>
