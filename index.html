  <h1>School Discipline in the State of Georgia</h1>
  <p>The State of Georgia’s student discipline data is collected, aggregated at the school level, and made publicly
    available
    by the <a href="https://gosa.georgia.gov/report-card-dashboards-data/downloadable-data">Governor’s Office of
      Student Achievement</a>. According to this data set, discipline incident refers to a student behavorial
    infraction
    for
    which the school issued one of the following consequences: alternative school, corporal punishment, detention,
    expulsion, in-school suspension, juvenile court/court referral, out-of-school suspension, physical restraint,
    removed
    from class, or suspension from bus. Such incidents are categorized as attendance/dress code, cheating,
    drugs/alcohol,
    gang-related behavior, harm to person, harm to property, repeated offenses, sexual offenses, or weapons.
  </p>
  <p>The tool below summarizes school discipline data from the 2016-2017 (the most recent year available) for a
    selected school or school system and shows trends since the 2013-2014 school year.
    By selecting different subgroup categories, you can explore the difference in enrollment population and
    disciplined popualtion for various subgroup
    categories: race/ethnicity, gender, disability status, economic status, and English learner status.</p>

  <p>In addition to the discipline data from the Governor's Office of Student Achievement, additional data on student
    enrollment by race was gathered from the <a href="data/https://educationdata.urban.org/data-explorer/"> Urban
      Institute's Education Data Explorer</a> tool.</p>
